  <h1>How I Started: </h1>
  <br><br>
  <p>So Basically I was a normal kid looking for a dream , kinda lost till one of my cool friends my best actually told me about coding
  and wasn't really motivated because I had thought about it once and really didn't like it but together we were motivated , we loved it actually
  <br><br>
  So When I got home I Started Learning C# but at the time I didnt really know why, They said it's easy so I kinda learnt it but It wasn't Something
  that Caught my Interest,then I learnt html then css and then javascript
  <br><br>

  After Making Websites for about 4 Months, I learnt C++ then Pyton Made couple of Programs then got bored of making Desktop Apps
  <br><br>

  And Then, I found my love , which was Machine Learning,
  <br>
  Well At first it was a pain actually because unlike the others it required a lot of math , and since I'm just a 16 y.o I kinda Suffered a little bit there
  but I didn't give up and I had to learn all what I need from advanced Statistics and Porbability ,Calculus all the good stuff, and then I got to the fun part (Coding)<br>

  First Couple of Months Were Pretty Hard But As always I didn't give up and I continued Learning and started participating in Data Sciense competetions
  and Using Random Datasets on the interent to do EDA on them and Currently after a lot of hard work (and pain ) I am sitting at the rank of 83 out of 2706 in a DataSciense Comeptetion Hosted by <a  style="color: yellow;" href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/">DrivenData</a>
  <br><br>
